- Status bar: Polybar
- Terminal: Alacritty
- Shell: Zsh
- Text Editor: NeoVim
- IDE: Spacemacs (I'm going to switch to something better soon)

** Personal build of sxiv
  Sxiv is customized using some scripts and xresources, but you change keybinds by configuring the source code, so I store all of my configuration in there.
  My build is also a ahead of the git version as I've merged some upcoming pull requests with my build.
